Sports Quiz App
Using jQuery and manipulating form fields I create a single page was made from scratch given a series of user and technical requirements to be user friendly and responsive.  Some of the requirements include:

Button to start the quiz
Only one question at a time
Can see current score and what question number they're on
Provide feedback and what the right answer was

One major problem I ran into and troubleshooted was having to turn event handlers off before using them again which was a good lesson to learn and I only caught it by accident since originally my questions had a few answers that were the same.
